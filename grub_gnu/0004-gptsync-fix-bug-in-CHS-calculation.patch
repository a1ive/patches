Subject: [PATCH 4/9] gptsync: fix bug in CHS calculation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

According to: http://starman.vertcomp.com/asm/mbr/PartTables.htm
For partitions which begin or end beyond  the 1024th cylinder,
the three CHS bytes should always be filled with: FE FF FF ;
which are decoded as follows:Byte 1:  FEh = 254
for a total of 255 heads.Bytes 2 and 3:  FFh and FFh
â€” split into two full binary counts of
6 bits (11 1111; 3Fh = 63 sectors), and 10 bits (11 1111 1111)
or 3FFh = 1023 for a total of 1024 cylinders. CHS: 1023, 254, 63.
